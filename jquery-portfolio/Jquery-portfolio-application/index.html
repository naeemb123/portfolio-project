              <p><i>With the full gamut of stylistic variations at your disposal,
                you will not have to rely on the unsatisfactory “faux” styles that are applied to a regular font when font-style:
                italic or font-weight: bold is called. Typefaces are not designed to be contorted in this way.
                Using the proper styles provided by a family like Bitstream (above) will make your typography not only more
                attractive but more accessible: dedicated italic glyphs have a much clearer intent than text that is simply “leaned over
                a bit.” The trick is to make sure that the declaration of, for example, font-style: italic requests the italic resource rather
                than triggers the faux style. It should be as effortless as using a system font family such as Georgia. This is probably best explained,
                 like so many things, in commented code. For brevity, we’ll set up just a regular font and an italic (not bold) style variation.</i></p>
